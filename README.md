testing range : x = 3 , y =5 , step = 0.5 , TP and SL = 1 (greater than 1)
# best params x= 3.5, y= 4 in backtest (sharpe ratio = 2.72)
# quick spot: I also tested x= 3.5, y= 4.5 (sharpe ratio = 2.19) in forward test , result is better than backtesting's best params, please reference in sharpe_heatmap.png and forward test files.
